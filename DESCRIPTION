Description: Flow is an R package that enables local configuration and execution
    of modules on annotated sets of entities (eg pairs, individuals, samples).
    Jobs can be either deployed locally or on LSF, then monitored and managed. Once
    jobs complete, their outputs can be attached back to their respective entities
    as annotations for easy import back into firehose or other databases. Like in
    firehose (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/firehose), a job consists
    of a task run on an entity (e.g. pair, individual, sample). A task wraps around
    a module and binds module arguments to names of entity-specific annotations
    or fixed literals which can represent paths (eg a bam file path) or values (eg
    200). A task also specifies the binding of module outputs to output annotations.
    A job is created by applying a task to a set of entities, which correspond to
    keyed table of entity-specific annotations (eg bam_file_wgs, seg_file, etc).
    Once a job completes, one or more output annotations (i.e. paths to output
    files) are attached to the respective entity in an output table. This table
    can now be merged into a flat "master" file or database of entity specific
    annotation. Coming soon: A Flow object, which will represent a workflow, or
    a collection of Tasks run on entities, but will have very similar properties
    (vectorization, run control, status updating).
